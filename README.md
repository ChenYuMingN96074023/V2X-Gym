V2X-Gym: a vehicular network simulation framework with reinforcement learning interface
============

[OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/) is a toolkit for reinforcement learning (RL) widely used in research. The network simulator [nsâ€“3](https://www.nsnam.org/) is the de-facto standard for academic and industry studies in the areas of networking protocols and communication technologies. ns3-gym is a framework that integrates both OpenAI Gym and ns-3 in order to encourage usage of RL in networking research.

Version
============
0.9

Installation
============

1. Install SUMO and its required dependencies.
```
sudo apt-get install cmake python g++ libxerces-c-dev libfox-1.6-dev libgdal-dev libproj-dev libgl2ps-dev swig
git clone --recursive https://github.com/eclipse/sumo
export SUMO_HOME="$PWD/sumo"
mkdir sumo/build/cmake-build && cd sumo/build/cmake-build
cmake ../..
make -j$(nproc)
```

2. Install all required dependencies required by ns-3.
```
# minimal requirements for C++:
apt-get install gcc g++ python

see https://www.nsnam.org/wiki/Installation
```
3. Install xml element
pip install elementpath

4. Install ZMQ and Protocol Buffers libs:
```
# to install protobuf-3.6 on ubuntu 16.04:
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:maarten-fonville/protobuf
sudo apt-get update

apt-get install libzmq5 libzmq5-dev
apt-get install libprotobuf-dev
apt-get install protobuf-compiler
```
5. Configure and build ns-3 project (if you are going to use Python virtual environment, please execute these commands inside it):
```
# Opengym Protocol Buffer messages (C++ and Python) are build during configure
./waf configure
./waf build
```

6. Install ns3gym located in src/opengym/model/ns3gym (Python3 required)
```
pip3 install ./src/opengym/model/ns3gym
```

7. (Optional) Install all libraries required by your agent (like tensorflow, keras, etc.).

Example: HelloV2XGym
========

All examples can be found [here](./scratch/).

## Basic Interface

1. Example Python script. Note, that `gym.make('ns3-v0')` starts ns-3 simulation script located in current working directory.
```
import gym
import ns3gym
import MyAgent

env = gym.make('ns3-v0')
obs = env.reset()
agent = MyAgent.Agent()

while True:
  action = agent.get_action(obs)
  obs, reward, done, info = env.step(action)

  if done:
    break
env.close()
```
